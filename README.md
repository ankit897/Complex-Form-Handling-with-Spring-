Workflow:

User Access:

User accesses the application and navigates to the form page (/showForm).
Form Submission:

Data is sent to the server-side endpoint (/processForm) for processing.
Processing:

The FormController processes the form data, performs any necessary business logic, and validates inputs.
Result Display:

The result, success message, or errors are displayed on the result page (/result-page).
Development Tools:

Spring Boot for easy project setup.
Spring MVC for handling web requests.
Thymeleaf for template rendering.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
Next Steps:

Enhance form validation and error handling.
Add additional form fields or features as needed.
Consider integrating with a database to persist form data.
Conclusion:
This project provides a foundation for handling complex forms in a Spring MVC application. It can be extended and customized based on specific requirements and further integrated into larger systems.
